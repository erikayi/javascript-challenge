# JavaScript Challenge Homework: Javascript and DOM Manipulation

Using a collection of data resources for UFO Sighting on the Earth, 
we need to analyze this big dataset made by `Aliens-R-Real`, and 
put them into a website for people to see the data and filter them by
specific values in the table. 

### Making a Table and Date Search 

### Part I

* First, design a cleaned HTML website for a Table.

* Second, write a code for categories in the table, which will 
search through the whole page, and, every time the user search
through the data by date, it will listen to every filtered data, and
it will write in the console.  

* Categories included: `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`,
`duration per minute`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* Here is the working site for Part I: https://erikayi.github.io/ufo-sighting-option1/

### Part II

* Created search bar using JQuery function in the Javascript code, and so that 
the user can filter through specific dates, cities, states, countries, shapes,
duration in minutes, shapes, and/or comments in the table provided.

* Here is the working site for Part II: https://erikayi.github.io/ufo-sighting-option2/
