# JavaScript Challenge Homework: Javascript and DOM Manipulation

Using a collection of data resources for UFO Sighting on the Earth, 
we need to analyze this big dataset made by `Aliens-R-Real`, and 
put them into website for people to see the data and filter them by
specific values in the table. 

### Making a Table and Date Search 

* First, design a cleaned HTML website for a Table.

* Second, write a code for categories in the table, which will 
search through the whole page, and plus, every time the user search
through the data by date, it will listen to every filtered data, and
it will write in the console.  

* Categories included: `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`,
`duration per minute`, `shape`, and `comment`.

### This is working on progress...
* Create multiple select dropdowns using Bootstrap Buttons in the HTML and
Javascript code, so that the user can also search through the table just by
clicking each filter of the table based on the table's columns.
